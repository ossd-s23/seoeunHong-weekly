# Week1: What is Open Source?

## What Open Source Means to me and why I decided to take this class

As studying computer science fields, I've heard the term **"Open Source"** quite often. Based on *my understading*, "Open Source" is a some <u>software's code</u> that <u>anyone</u> can read, <u>modify, and disrtibute</u>. 

The idea of ***sharing*** the code that one came up with with everyone and all others ***working together*** to develop the code or software and correct errors within the software for the <u>growth</u> and <u>development</u> of the <u>whole community</u> was very fascinating and attractive to me. However, I've never tried contributing on any open source project because of my *worries* and *uncertainty* like "What if I misunderstand of the whole code and contribute in wrong way, so I just take up their valuable time" or "What if my question is just a stupid question"

Therefore, I decided totake this class because I wanted to learn <u>what open source</u> is more "**deeply**" and <u>how to contribute</u> "**properly**".
