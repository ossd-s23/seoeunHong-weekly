# Week1: What is Open Source?

## What Open Source Means to me and why I decided to take this class

As a computer science student, I've often heard the term "**Open Source**". Based on *my understanding*, "Open Source" refers to <u>software code</u> that can be <u>read</u>, <u>modified</u>, and <u>distributed</u> by <u>anyone</u>.

The idea of ***sharing*** code and ***working together*** as a community to <u>develop</u> and <u>improve</u> software was very appealing to me. However, I've never tried contributing to an open source project due to *worries* and *uncertainty*, such as "What if I misunderstand the code and contribute in the wrong way, taking up valuable time," or "What if my question is silly."

Therefore, I decided to take this class to learn more about <u>what open source is</u> and how to <u>properly contribute</u> to projects.

## Advantage and Disadvantage of Open Source

- **Advantages**

  - With many people joining the project, unexpected solutions can arise at a fast pace.
  - The open-source code allows the community to learn a lot by reading it.
  - With many contributors, the project becomes flexible and scalable.

  **Disadvantages**

  - This can be slightly risky, as everyone can see the source code and its flaws. While it's ideal to fix them, some people might misuse the information.
  - There is no documented file or site for the code, making it difficult for users to fully understand it.
  - There is no definite timeline for tasks to be completed, so one may have to wait for the community to solve an issue, or it may never be solved if the project isn't popular enough.

## Open Source Project Examples

### Git

### OpenStreetMap

### Wikipedia

### FreeCodeCamp
