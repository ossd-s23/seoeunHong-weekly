# Our Third Guest Speaker: Christopher Snider

This week, we had our third guest speaker, [Christopher Snider](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherasnider/) from [Tidepool](https://www.tidepool.org/). I was already interested in this project because, personally, my father has diabetes and when I was young, I wanted to study all subjects that could cure his illness. I never thought that I could contribute to the diabetes community with my computer science knowledge, but with this project, it seems possible, so I looked it up. However, I gave up at the end because this project did not seem to be open source for contributors.

Although I couldn't contribute to this project as a contributor, I was happy to hear his presentation to learn more about this Tidepool project. His presentation was more interesting than I thought because, even though it was a one-hour Zoom presentation, I could feel his passion for this project. As a person who has diabetes, he wanted to contribute to this community, so he got involved in this project. The most impressive thing he said was that whenever he wakes up in the morning, he always thinks about how this project can be better that day. This made me think about whether I had ever felt that kind of enthusiasm and passion for any project or what I am studying. It made me reflect on my life so far.

Another interesting thing was the process for building this program and dealing with errors. I was curious about it because this program is related to human health directly, and their software updates or bugs might impact a lot on human health. About this, Christopher said that the Tidepool project has a circular work sprint. Before releasing their program update or new features, they go through program verification work circles and then release the program. Many bugs are filtered at these points.

It was also interesting to hear about how this program started and ended up getting  [FDA clearance](https://www.tidepool.org/blog/tidepool-loop-has-received-fda-clearance) for their Tidepool Loop. This program first started from the  [Do-it-yourself Loop](https://medium.com/@loudnate/the-history-of-loop-and-loopkit-59b3caf13805)  that active patient communities actively found a way to cure their disease. Tidepool started by adding new and more features to that loop. Also, with lots of innovation, they finally got FDA clearance for their project. Even though it's the nature of open source, this project successfully proved their device's effectiveness and safety with their validation sprint workflow and by dealing with patients' data and keeping it private.

This presentation gave me a new perspective not only on the open-source approach to important issues such as human health but also on my life.

# Group Project Contribution On Going

After making our first code base contribution, our group tried to make more contributions, but found it to be harder than we had initially thought. While browsing through their website, we came across [this bug](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/17917#issue-1651186654) where the search bar at the bottom of the page was cut off. We tried to contribute to the community by reporting and fixing the issue. We suggested [an approach](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/17917#issuecomment-1493536368) to solve this issue by changing the placeholder text, but the maintainer wanted to solve it by [making the search bar longer](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/17917#issuecomment-1494640289). With this suggestion, we tried to solve the issue, but it was related to AngularJS and none of our group members knew how to deal with it, so we left it to other community members to solve.

In addition, we found a few more bugs such as [an issue with the language selection bar](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/17973#issue-1658175429), [a placeholder issue](https://github.com/oppia/lessons-team/issues/703#issue-1660340670), [a text misalignment issue](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues/17997#issue-1661091377), and others, and tried to solve them while reporting the issues. However, all of them were related to AngularJS, and some were related to the backend, making it difficult for us to contribute.

Furthermore, for our first code contribution, we were asked to change our CSS to "component," which was related to AngularJS. We found a description of it on their wiki, but the link to the [guidelines](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Coding-style-guide#css) was broken, so we couldn't figure out how to change it to a "component." We left a [message](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/pull/17884#discussion_r1161897816) for the maintainers and are waiting for their response.

We still want to make more contributions, but it seems to be more difficult than we initially thought. Nonetheless, we will keep trying to make contributions to the best of our abilities for the rest of the semester.
