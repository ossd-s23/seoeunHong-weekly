Hello, I am <span style="color:#005b96">**Seoeun Hong**</span> studying **computer science** and **mathematics** at <span style="color:#57068c">**NYU**</span>ðŸŽ“.

Since last fall semester, I got really interested in **processing data** and **ML/AI** field, so doing several studying by myself, joining programs and projects, and taking classes.

Hopefully, this year, I can achieve more, especially in ML/AI and data field that last year
